# Shell scripts
A collection of shell scripts I use.

# Menu script for wget
I archive a lot. Hence the incredible amount of scripts and cron entries to make it happen. Sometimes I want or need to download specific files. I've a default script template that pulls its links from a *.txt file. This menu shows a nice front-end to manipulate the links file.

Copu to the location where you keep your scripts
Do chmod 750 {SCRIPT_NAME]
Run as./[SCRIPT_NAME]
